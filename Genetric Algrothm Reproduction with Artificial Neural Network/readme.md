## Reproducing Genetic Algorithm Generated CNC Cutting Parameters with a Neural Network
### Introduction

This notebook aims to reproduce the output data of Multi-Objective Optimization of Turning Process during Machining of AlMg1SiCu (Aluminum) Using Non-Dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm by Rahul Dhabalea, VijayKumar S. Jattib, and T.P.Singhc. The study used a genetic algorithm (GA) to generate novel cutting parameters and predict material removal rate & surface roughness. The study can be found here for further reading but some explanation will follow, mainly concerning the differences between goals and the methodology used in creating the artificial neural network (ANN).

# ML Examples

This is a repository for any Kaggle compeitions or other generic ML examples I've worked on. These are for exercise purposes only. Some may be a work in progress.

I'm posting them here as examples for others, but if anyone is looking through and has a suggestion, particularly how to make a code block more elegant or there is a mistake, please feel free to comment.

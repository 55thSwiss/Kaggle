# Kaggle

This is a repository for any Kaggle compeitions I've done, generally I don't submit on Kaggle, it's just for exercise. Some may be a work in progress, and will be stated in the heading.

I'm posting them here as examples for others, but if anyone is looking through and has a suggestion, particularly how to make a code block more elegant, please feel free to comment.
